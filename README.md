# Excel_CPI_INFLATION_casestudy
This repository contains a comprehensive Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation analysis conducted using Microsoft Excel. The project demonstrates a structured data analysis workflow, encompassing data preparation, trend analysis, and visual storytelling through dashboards and charts.

The purpose of the project is to explore how CPI and inflation evolve over time across categories, identify patterns, and derive insights that help understand the behaviour of inflationary pressures in the economy. The analysis is entirely implemented in Excel without programming languages, showcasing strong spreadsheet skills, data manipulation, visualization, and business-oriented interpretation.
